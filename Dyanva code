  <h3>Health & Safety</h3>
  <p>OHS, emergency, and infection control policies.</p>
  <div class="policy-details">
    <p>DyanVa Family Services Ltd. is committed to ensuring that every person within its facilities is protected from injury or illness. To promote and maintain a safe, healthy, and hazard-free environment for residents, staff, and visitors, we adhere to Alberta’s Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) regulations and supportive living standards. Safety is a shared responsibility, and all staff, residents, and management work together to identify risks, report hazards, and uphold safe practices. Our ultimate goal is to prevent accidents before they occur and to ensure that all emergencies are managed calmly, confidently, and efficiently.
Health & Safety Objectives
The primary objective of our health and safety program is to protect the well-being of residents, staff, and visitors. We aim to maintain full compliance with all municipal and provincial health and safety standards. Workplace injuries are prevented through proactive training and awareness, while ongoing reporting and hazard identification are strongly encouraged. Additionally, we ensure that emergency procedures are well understood and practiced by all members of the organization.
Staff Responsibilities
All staff are required to follow health, safety, and infection-control procedures at all times. Hazards, unsafe conditions, or incidents must be reported immediately to a supervisor. Staff are expected to attend mandatory safety and emergency preparedness training and use protective equipment (PPE) as required. Accurate incident and injury reports must be maintained, and staff are encouraged to model safe practices for both residents and coworkers.
Management Responsibilities
Management is responsible for providing a safe physical environment, including cleanliness, adequate lighting, fire safety, and secure exits. Regular safety inspections and audits must be conducted, and any safety incidents investigated and resolved promptly. Management is also tasked with supplying the necessary training, PPE, and first aid materials. It is essential that all staff have access to emergency protocols and contact numbers to ensure a quick and effective response in any situation.    Resident Involvement
Residents are encouraged to:
Participate in safety drills.
Report unsafe conditions to staff.
Follow guidance during emergencies.
Maintain personal hygiene and report illness promptly.

Safety is everyone’s responsibility — when we care for each other, we protect each other.💙</p>

  <h3>Admission & Discharge</h3>
  <p>Clear and person-centred processes.</p>
  <div class="policy-details">
    <p>Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the admission and discharge of residents at DyanVa Family Services Ltd. are conducted in a fair, transparent, and person-centred manner, consistent with Alberta’s licensing and care standards.
Policy Statement
DyanVa Family Services Ltd. accepts residents whose needs align with our program’s purpose, staffing qualifications, and available resources. All admissions and discharges are handled with sensitivity, professionalism, and respect for the rights and dignity of the resident.
Admission Criteria
Admission decisions are based on a thorough assessment of the resident’s developmental, behavioural, and emotional needs. Compatibility with existing residents and program capacity is considered, alongside safety considerations for both the individual and others in care. Referrals and documentation from authorized agencies, such as Alberta Health Services, PDD, or Children’s Services, are required. Admission is confirmed through a signed Service Agreement that outlines program expectations, resident rights, and responsibilities.
Admission Procedures
The admission process begins with a review of referral documents, assessments, and recommendations by management. A pre-admission interview is conducted with the resident, and, where applicable, their family or caseworker, to discuss care goals and program expectations. The team then evaluates the resident’s potential impact on current residents and program resources. Once approved by the Director, all intake forms, medical records, and consents are completed. Finally, new residents receive an orientation, including a friendly introduction to the home, daily routines, staff, and peer community.
Resident Rights During Admission
Residents have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, to be informed about program rules, expectations, and routines, and to receive clear information about grievance procedures and privacy rights. They also have access to personal belongings and family contact, unless restrictions are necessary for safety reasons.
Discharge Criteria
A resident may be discharged when program goals have been achieved and they are ready to transition to a lower level of support, when the resident, guardian, or placing agency requests discharge, when the resident’s needs exceed the program’s capacity or resources, or when safety risks require alternate placement. All discharges are planned collaboratively whenever possible.
Discharge Procedures
The discharge process begins with a case review in consultation with the resident, guardian, and referral agency. Transition planning ensures support for the next placement, including proper documentation and continuity of care. A discharge summary and exit report are completed and signed, and all personal belongings are returned to the resident or guardian. Where appropriate, staff may conduct a follow-up call or report to ensure a successful transition.
Emergency Discharge
In rare cases where immediate removal is necessary for safety reasons, the Director will notify the placing agency immediately, document the incident and rationale in detail, and ensure the resident’s safety and dignity throughout the transition.</p>
